        The editor application is a Windows destkop application that allows editting of source files as well as debugging with the interpreter.<br>
        It is intended to be ran from Visual Studio for debugging purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Under the edit menu item there's a configuration item (Options) that enables configuration of:
        <ul>
            <li>The default location for source files.
            <li>The default file extension for source files.
            <li>Enabling debug mode.
        </ul> 
    </p>
    <p>
        Setting the default source file location will cause the open/save/as options to initally start in this folder.
    </p>
    <p>
        Setting the default file extension sets the filename of a newly created file to "new.&lt;fileextension&gt".
    </p>
    <p>
        Enabling debug mode is intended for the test case where the editor is being debugged from Visual Studio.<br>
        With debug mode enabled, exceptions are not caught in a try/catch block causing Visual Studio to break <br>
        execution at the location where the exception occurs, allowing for a better debugging experience.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The editor is a simple text editor with line numbers showing. <br>
        The text in the editor can be saved and new text can be loaded from files.<br>
        Text can be searched through with the standard find (Ctrl-F) text searcher.<br>
        If multiple ocurrances existed F3 will search for the next matching text part.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        At the bottom of the editor there are 4 tabs containing the below information if the file was executed through debug/debug.
        <ul>
            <li>Output -&gt; Shows the output of the interpreter.
            <li>Ast Tree -&gt; Shows the AST tree created by the parser.
            <li>Scope Tree -&gt; Shows the tree of scopes detected/created by the interpreter.
            <li>Lexer output -&gt; Shows the list of tokens that were created by the lexer.
        </ul>
    </p>
