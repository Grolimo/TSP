# TSP
The Simple Project version 0.5.0.3

The simple project consists of a simple programming language, an editor and a cli interpreter.

Please note that this language isn't intended to be object orientated.
It can be used for a "functional programming" style.

Variable type is set on assignment.
Arrays, records, structs, functions and procedures are all copied/cloned on assignment, i.e. it's not a reference but a new instance with the same content

Missing features:
- Library/(sub)file inclusion from code.
- Compiler.

Documentation can be found here:
https://www.0xc007.nl/Simple.html

Please note that the docs are a bit older than the actual implementation although no real 
changes where made to the language itself, it's implementation has changed.
