The Simple Project

Please note that this language isn't intended to be object orientated.
It can be used for a "functional programming" style.

Variable type is set on assignment.

Current version is 0.5.0.1

Missing features:
- Structs.
- Library/(sub)file inclusion from code.
- Compiler.

Documentation can be found here:

Please note that the docs are a bit older than the actual implementation although no real 
changes where made to the language itself, it's implementation has changed.
