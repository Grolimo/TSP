#Contributing to TSP

If you want to contribute to TSP just keep in mind the following things:

-> The project revolves around the simple language (TSL).

-> The editor is just a tool for helping me debug the language, 
   it is by no means intended as a fully fledged IDE, nor should it become this.
   If you want to build an IDE for TSL just create a new project on github for 
   yourself and use "language.dll" to link in the language.
   If you want/need help, or changes in TSL are required, just submit them to 
   me via the e-mail addres below or put it on the discussion forum here on Github.

-> The cli tool is just so you could "execute" the code without the need of an ide.
   Please note it's just a simple wrapper around the "interpreter".

-> Libraries are currently embedded in language.dll and pre-compiled.
   The endgoal is to have them provided as TSL source code only, to be linked in at compile/runtime.

Submissions, bugs, etc. need to be sent to marco@0xc007.nl
