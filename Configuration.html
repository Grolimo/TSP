    <p>
        The SimpleConfiguration project is to provide a very simple library that can be used for reading and writing configuration files.
    </p>
    <p>
        Configuration is the central class for this library, it's a static class so no need to instantiate anything.<br><br>
        The configuration is stored in a JSon File that can be loaded with the Load method that takes the file path as a parmater.<br>
        When the configuration has changed it can be saved with the Save method.<br>
        In case a copy/backup is needed there is the SaveAs method that has the file path as a parameter.<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The configuration itself can be acessed through the Sections property.
        It is a fully implemented collection, but it also has an array like accessor.
        The array accessor type is the easiest way of working it.
        
        Example:</p>
    <div>
        <pre>
                <b>var</b> KeyNameSection = Configuration.Sections["keyname"];
        </pre>
    </div>
    <p>
        If a section with keyname didn't exit yet, one is created and added to the collection automatically.
    </p>
    <p>
        A section can have one or more items. Items is like sections a fully implemented collection with array accessors.
        An example of getting a specific named item from the section is:
        <pre>

                <b>var</b> Item = KeyNameSection.Items["itemname"];
        </pre>
        If an Item with itemname didn't exist before it is automatically created and added to the section.
    </p>
    <p>
        The configuration item has a Value property which is a string.
        An example of getting the value of the item is:
        <pre>

            string Value = Item.Value;
        </pre>

        Setting the value of the item is as simple as assigning to the value:
        <pre>

            Item.Value = "new value";
        </pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        It is also very possible to directly access and manipulate the value of an item in this way:
        <pre>

            string oldvalue = Configuration.Sections["section"]["item"].Value;
            Configuration.Sections["section"]["item"].Value = $"new_{oldvalue}";
        </pre>
        Don't forget to call Configuration.Save() or Configuration.SaveAs("filename") to store the configuration changes.
    </p>
